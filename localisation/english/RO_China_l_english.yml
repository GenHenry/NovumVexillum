 ro_china.introgame.1.t: "The Year of the Dragon"
 ro_china.introgame.1.desc: "According to the Chinese calendar, the year 2000 is the 'Year of the Dragon'. It is also the time when China, which claims to be a dragon, gradually begins to show its enormous power out of the chaos of the 20th century. And the Year of the Dragon, the eyes of a giant dragon, is aiming for Formosa, a small island. On July 9, 1999, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui stated that the relationship between China and Taiwan was 'state-to-state', which angered the Communist Party of China, which claimed that Taiwan was part of China.\n\nChina is trying to crush the spirit of separatism by intimidating the Taiwanese, as it did in the 1996 presidential election. Once again, the Chinese government has begun to make comments about the \"full-scale invasion of Taiwan\" and the south of China is under extreme tension."
 ro_china.introgame.1.a: "Our sword is ready to hunt the Dragon!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.2.a: "Let's make them kneel before the Dragon!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.3.t: "The Divided Kuomintang"
 ro_china.introgame.3.desc: "Ahead of the 2000 presidential election, Kuomintang is divided into two forces; Lien Chan, an legitimacial candidate backed by Lee Teng-hui, and James Soong, a non-mainstream candidate who opposes him. Lien Chan insists on the integration of China and Taiwan, and considers ways for Taiwan to gain autonomy inside Chinese territory. Because it is a negative thing for Pan-Green that he gets a boost, Pan-Green political forces should expect their rival James Soong's political influence to rise and take away enough of Lien's approval rating."
 
 ro_china.introgame.3.a: "James Soong should be able to gain enough influence!"
 ro_china.introgame.3.b: "Target James Soong's weaknesses!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.4.a: "Target James Soong's weaknesses!"
 ro_china.introgame.4.b: "It is dangerous to intervene in Kuomintang Internal Confrontation."
 
 ro_china.introgame.5.t: "James Soong Under Political Attack"
 ro_china.introgame.5.desc: "Several Taiwanese internet communities simultaneously criticized James Soong and began to criticize him for destroying the Kuomintang's chances of victory. Because this move was so sudden that we could not anticipate it, politicians at the DPP suspect there was an intervention from Mainland China."
 ro_china.introgame.5.a: "There's no way they won't interfere in this election."
 
 ro_china.introgame.6.t: "James Soong's Controversy over Corruption"
 ro_china.introgame.6.desc: "Kuomintang non-mainstream candidate James Soong has been hit by a serious corruption controversy. James Soong was suspected of embezzling a lot of money from inside KMT for personal use in the past. James Soong was supported by the public because he had an image of integrity, and his corruption controversy took a toll on his political influence.\n\nThe variable is this. James Soong has seen a significant decline in his approval rating, but he still has many supporters. Even if he is confident of losing the election, his chances of winning the DPP will increase if he does not step down as a candidate by the last minute. In order for Kuomintang to win, it is necessary to force James Soong to voluntarily abandon the election. But would he agree with that?"
 ro_china.introgame.6.a: "This will be a huge variable in the election."
 
 ro_china.introgame.7.a: "For Lien Chen's victory, we may need to step in."
 
 ro_china.introgame.8.t: "James Soong to Rally his Approval Ratings Again"
 ro_china.introgame.8.desc: "James Soong is rallying his supporters again despite the corruption controversy. Although James Soong's political corruption issues have caused great controversy, the problem is Lien Chen's pro-china tendency. Lien Chen hopes that Taiwan and Mainland China will be able to reunify through the federal system, thereby gaining autonomy within China. Citizens who fear that Taiwan will be controlled by China if Lien takes power still think of James Soong as an alternative."
 ro_china.introgame.8.a: "Federal Reunification may be the answer..."
 ro_china.introgame.8.b: "Encourage supporters of Lien Chen to further support James Soong."
 
 ro_china.introgame.9.a: "Can't we assassinate James Soong?"
 ro_china.introgame.9.b: "Let's further attack the DPP and encourage Lien Chen to expand his base."
 
 ro_china.introgame.10.t: "Injured James Soong"
 ro_china.introgame.10.desc: "There was not a long time left until the election to formulate a proper assassination plan, and we had very little time left. We approached Taiwan's pro-china socialist forces and succeeded in delivering weapons to them, but the half-baked attempts of non-professional socialists only slightly hurt him. The attempt is expected to further boost James Soong's approval rating, forcing the CPC's inner circle to admit that the radical provocation was a mistake."
 ro_china.introgame.10.a: "It was an unreasonable attempt."
 
 ro_china.introgame.11.desc: "Today, a socialist young man in Taiwan fired a pistol at James Soong, who was addressing the public. The bullet grazed his shoulder, and he suffered minor injuries. The terrorist was immediately overwhelmed by Soong's supporters at the scene. Although the arrested socialist youth is using his right to remain silent, this attempt appears to have been part of the Communist Party of China's hardline election interference attempt. The attempt is expected to further boost James Soong's approval rating."
 ro_china.introgame.11.a: "Bloody Chinese..."
 
 ro_china.introgame.12.t: "Lien Chen Earning Approval Ratings"
 ro_china.introgame.12.desc: "Still, the KMT's confrontation continues, but Lien Chen's approval rating continues to recover. Lien Chen continues to campaign in many cities and talks about the importance of integration with China."
 ro_china.introgame.12.a: "The election is coming..."
 
 ro_china.introgame.13.a: "We look forward to his good performance."
 
 ro_china.introgame.14.t: "Chen Shui-bian's Speak"
 ro_china.introgame.14.desc: "DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian must make the choice to secure his supporters. Even if it disappoints some of his supporters, he can  shows an ambiguous message about  independence, or he makes a tougher independence claim against China. A tougher independence claim will enthrall supporters, but will provoke the Communist Party of China."
 ro_china.introgame.14.a: "Independence is a very cautious issue."
 ro_china.introgame.14.b: "We want independence RIGHT NOW!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.15.desc: "In order not to provoke the CPC, Chen, the DPP candidate, has recently stopped making tough separatist claims. He seems to think that even if he disappoints some of his supporters, maintaining the status quo is a more appropriate option to prevent war."
 ro_china.introgame.15.a: "He made a wise choice."
 
 ro_china.introgame.16.desc: "\"We want independence. Not the future, right now!\"\n\nDPP candidate Chen Shui-bian's argument has recently become increasingly tough, and he insists the \"Republic of China\" needs to be transformed into a \"Taiwanese Republic\" as soon as possible. This angered important CPC politicians, and hardliners began to argue that Taiwan needs to be invaded immediately depending on the election results."
 ro_china.introgame.16.a: "Does he really want a war?"
 
 ro_china.introgame.17.t: "Yuan T. Lee's Declaration of Support for the DPP"
 ro_china.introgame.17.desc: "Yuan T. Lee, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry and a celebrity in Taiwan, has officially decided to support Chen. Due to his high social influence, Chen is expected to benefit more from election."
 ro_china.introgame.17.a: "The election is coming..."
 
 ro_china.introgame.18.a: "That's a stupid choice."
 
 ro_china.introgame.19.t: "The 2000 Taiwanese Presidential Election"
 ro_china.introgame.19.desc: "When the election first began, KMT's victory seemed most likely. However, the KMT split into two candidates, Lien Chan and James Soong, and the DPP succeeded in rallying its supporters. But there is still the possibility of KMT's last reversal. Lien Chan laughs at the DPP's hope \"independent Taiwan\", arguing that Mainland China and Taiwan should be unified as one country. Lien Chan claims it is a \"federal\" proposal, and believes Taiwanese citizens will be able to enjoy autonomy at Beijing's mercy. But if Lien Chan wins, will mainland China really recognize Taiwan's self-government? Chen Shui-bian wants to protect Taiwan's democracy not at China's mercy, but on Taiwan's own. In the end, the winner will decide Taiwan's future."
 ro_china.introgame.19.a: "Chen Shui-bian! (Democratic Progressive Party)"
 ro_china.introgame.19.b: "Lien Chan! (Kuomintang)"
 #ro_china.introgame.19.c: "James Soong! (Independence)"
 
 ro_china.introgame.20.t: "The End of the History of the Republic of China"
 ro_china.introgame.20.desc: "Kuomintang's [CHI.GetLeader] finally started negotiations to unite the two divided China and bring the Chinese together in accordance with pan-nationalism. Although the separatists of the DPP continue to protest in Taipei, their resistance will be meaningless. [CHI.GetLeader] has already met [PRC.GetLeader] in Beijing, and together discussed how Taiwan can enjoy autonomy under the rule of the Kuomintang.\n\n[PRC.GetLeader] said he would arrest the DPP and other "separatist" parties members at a fast pace, and instead acknowledge the autonomy of \"patriotic\" Taiwanese parties that support pan-nationalist ideologies. Although this will be the eternal end to 'Taiwan separatism', [CHI.GetLeader] chose to reunification of a divided China. but We not yet known how happy this future will be for Taiwanese."
 ro_china.introgame.20.a: "We have burned the bridge, and we have no choice but to move forward."
 
 ro_china.introgame.21.a: "That's wonderful news."
 
 ro_china.introgame.22.t: "DPP's Takeover of Taiwan"
 ro_china.introgame.22.desc: "We were quite hoping for Kuomintang's victory in the presidential election, but unfortunately, because Kuomintang was split into two candidates, KMT's victory was practically impossible. Eventually, Chen Shui-bian, a DPP separatist, was elected president, and some hawks argued that Taiwan should be invaded immediately. The problem is that our navy is not fully ready yet, and we don't have enough military power to go to war with [USA.GetNameDef]. It would be necessary to liberate Taiwan, which it calls themself the \"Republic of China\", but it would not be necessary to act too hastily. When we finish modernizing our armed forces, we will have a chance to liberate Taiwan."
 ro_china.introgame.22.a: "We need to prepare for the future."
 
 ro_china.introgame.23.t: "History does not End"
 ro_china.introgame.23.desc: "When this election first started, the DPP's chances of winning were not that high. But the division of the Kuomintang brought opportunities for the DPP, and the separatists were able to achieve a great victory. Mainland China is very angry about the outcome of the election, but as in 1996, it will not lead directly to war. China has yet to complete its naval modernization, and they is not ready to make military landfall on the island of Taiwan. But they're going to continue to attack Taiwan, they're going to try to sabotage our independence. We have to prepare for all risks during our four-year term..."
 ro_china.introgame.23.a: "We have burned the bridge, and we have no choice but to move forward."

 ro_china.joint_events.1.t: "The True-name Movement of Taiwan"
 ro_china.joint_events.1.desc: "The True-name movement, which can be written Zhèngmíng in Mandarin, or Chiàⁿ-miâ in Taiwanese, is a move to stop using the incorrect name \"China\" in Taiwan. Throughout the 20th century, the 'Republic of China' government in Taiwan used the name 'China' to name all the important facilities in the country. However, this was considered a very misnomer by Taiwanese separatists. Since Taiwan had to become the 'Taiwan Republic' with a different identity from China, it was considered unreasonable to use China as the name of its organization. Following this move, the DPP began the process of removing the name 'China' one by one from various government names. In the long run, it aims to go beyond simple name changes, teaching Chinese history as foreign history in textbooks, and lastly changing the country's name."
 ro_china.joint_events.1.a: "Taiwanese should be able to use the right name."
 
 ro_china.joint_events.2.t: "[CHI.GetName]'s Soft Power"
 ro_china.joint_events.2.desc: "Taiwanese Popular culture, which can be called Taiwan's Soft Power, can be analyzed as a combination of two countries cultures; China and Japan. Taiwan's indigenous people already make up a small percentage of the population, and most of the country's population has become Han People. Han People brought several kinds of traditions from Mainland China, and these Han People traditions gradually changed on Formosa Island and became the new Taiwanese tradition.\n\nIn comparison, modern Taiwanese culture is based in Japan. During the Japanese colonial period, Taiwan was under relatively moderate rule, and the country naturally embraced various modern Japanese cultures while undergoing Japanese colonization. In 1945, Japan withdrew from Formosa, but the Taiwanese have continued to naturally consume Japanese culture as a popular culture since then.\n\nAnd then it's the 21st century. We need Taiwan's pop culture that is differentiated from mainland China. Japan is the most reasonable alternative to growing Taiwan's Soft Power. Their pop culture is already familiar to us and can be accepted without resistance. But maybe a fast-growing Korea can be an alternative."

 ro_china.joint_events.3.desc: "During Taiwan's 2000 presidential election, there was an atmosphere of war between the two sides, but fortunately, the crisis did not escalate into a real war. Taiwan and Mainland China are very close, and if peace persists, they will be able to benefit from each other's trade."

 ro_china.joint_events.5.desc: "The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, or ECFA for short, is an agreement between Taiwan and mainland China to cut tariffs on each other's goods. The agreement is expected to allow Taiwan and mainland China to conduct more trade with each other. Of course, this agreement will provide economic benefits for both Taiwan and Mainland China, but some of Taiwan's Pan Green factions fear it could subordinate the Taiwanese economy to China."

 ro_china.joint_events.7.desc: "Kuomintang, the leader of the Pan blue faction that supports peace and integration with mainland China, has lost much of its Cold War anti-communist ideology and is suspected of becoming a de facto pro-China party. That's why Mainland China is suspected of supporting the KMT to expand its influence in Taiwan, and rumors are circulating that some KMT politicians have received donations from Mainland China. For now, this is just a rumor without clear evidence, but Taiwan Pan Green politicians hope that rumors of mainland China's involvement in Taiwanese politics are not true."

 ro_china.early_events.1.desc: "Two National Defense Laws means two laws designed to reform the armed forces of the Republic of China, which was a military dictatorship in the 20th century. The first law is to separate the military from politics so that the military forces cannot influence politics by designating only civilians to become defense ministers. The second law is a clause that weakens and reforms military organizations that have been overly militaristic so that the government can control them.\n\nAlthough the military will not be happy with these reforms, there is no movement of violent opposition, including coups, thanks to the results of the democratic revolution that has already been around since the 1990s.

Unlike mainland China, which oppresses Catholics, Taiwan has a free guarantee of various religions, which is possible because the island is defending the values of \"democracy\" that mainland China does not have.

We don't know if it's because the smoke from the firecrackers blocked the sniper's view, or just because they were lucky. The injuries to the two were not serious. What's important is that the sniping has strongly rallied supporters of Chen. Many citizens were strongly angry at this attempt to threaten Taiwan's democracy by killing the Pan Green faction leader, and Kuomintang leader Lien Chan's claim that the attempted assassination was a faked did not gain much traction. Chen Shui-bian won the election a few hours later, and DPP could get four more years."

Eventually, after the vote count, Annette Lu was elected [ROOT.GetName]'s first female president."

In the confusion, Annette Lu was told by a doctor that President Chen Shui-bian was likely to die and that the surgery was unlikely to succeed.\n\nAs already angry DPP supporters took to the streets to try to attack Kuomintang, Annette Lu had to hold an emergency press conference to calm the citizens after first aid. She spoke calmly to the public; elections will go on as normal.

Does this mean the start of [PRC.GetName]'s military operation? Are [PRC.GetAdjective] troops already coming toward Taiwan Island? Some hours later, when [PRC.GetAdjective] air force did not bomb Taipei, it became clear that the assassination was not [PRC.GetName]'s attempt.\n\nPerhaps today will be an unforgettable day in Yu's life. Even if there's a lot of time ahead. First of all, Yu Shyi-kun had a mission to stop the anarchy in Taiwan.

Each country can draw a number card through decisions. The two countries must draw a card and make a score close to the number 21. If both countries have lower numbers than 21, the country with higher numbers wins. If both countries have the same number, it is draw. If a country gets more than 21, it loses. But if both countries get more than 21, it is draw.\n\nChina can expand Pan Blue's influence in Taiwan, where wins, draws and losses come from.

The alternative is to use one of the two popular music in Taiwan.\n\nCreated in 1993, Taiwan the Formosa is a representative song that symbolises Taiwan's separatism. This song depicts taiwan's geographical beauty and its history of being freed from external aggression.\n\nAnother song written in the 1970s, The Beautiful Island, is similar to Taiwan the Formosa in that it supports the separatism of the island. Both songs are popular among Taiwanese separatists, and the public will be positive no matter which song we choose."

 #Characters desc
 POLITICS_LEE_TENG_HUI_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 15th January 1923, in Sanshi Village, Taihoku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan\n§YPolitical Career:§! Lee Teng-hui, known by his birth name as Masao Iwasato, was born and raised in Japanese Taiwan, where he learned about bushido and the Japanese culture. In 1945, during the Bombing of Tokyo, he commanded anti-aircraft guns as a second lieutenant and engaged with the american military.\n\nDespite his efforts, Japan was defeated in World War II. After Japan's defeat, he returned to Taiwan, where he saw the Kuomintang regime's military repression on the 'February 28 incident', in which they massacred Benshengren, taiwanese native. He joined the Communist Party out of hatred for the KMT, but left it two years later because communism was too 'unrealistic' to save Taiwan.\n\nHe decided to free the citizens of Taiwan from the 'white horrors' of the KMT, and unlike other Taiwanese pro-democracy activists, he directly joined the KMT, which he hated, to try to reform from within. Having gained power within the KMT, he became Taiwan's leader in 1988, and by the early 1990s he had been working with the country's DPP leaders to implement gradual democratic reforms in the country's military dictatorship. He was given the nickname of 'Mr. Democracy' and became a symbol of democracy in Taiwan."
 
 POLITICS_LIEN_CHAN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 27th August 1936, in Xi'an, Shaanxi, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! \"China and Japan will battle inevitably. If the child born is a boy, name him Lien Chan, signifying that the strength coming from within oneself will never diminish and can overcome the enemies and be victorious. It also has the meaning of reviving the former nation, reorganizing the light and hope of our homeland.\"\n\nJust like his name, which his grandfather, Lien Heng, gave himself, Lien Chan lived a life to regain the light and hope of his country. He designed welfare programs for Taiwanese residents and worked to achieve Taiwan's diplomatic achievements despite international isolation\n\nAnd, reunification with mainland china is the last hope he can leave for his citizens. Can Taiwan survive alone in the 21st century? Already isolated internationally, Taiwan will enjoy greater prosperity not as a country but as a self-governing province aided by its benevolent father, PR China.\n\nHe does not think that the attempt to incorporate Taiwan into mainland China is a treasonous act against its citizens. It is a disaster for the 'Republic of China', but for its citizens, it gives them the right to become citizens of a powerful nation. That is why this is a grace, and a reward for his citizens."
 
 POLITICS_CHEN_SHUI_BIAN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 12th October 1950, in Guantian District, Tainan County, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! Are Taiwanese Chinese? Kuomintang would say, 'Yes!' But Chen \"A-bian\" Shui-bian knows the teeth of a poisonous snake hidden in the sweet lie. Since the defeat of the Japanese Empire in 1945, the KMT has been conducting decades of military dictatorship on the island of Taiwan. For the Chinese, Taiwan was another colony, and they never considered Taiwan an equal.\n\nA former lawyer, he entered politics in the 1980s through the 'Tangwai' movement, a pro-democracy movement in Taiwan. Chen Shui-bian used his lawyer's career to support pro-democracy activists who were unfairly suppressed, and gained social influence in the process.\n\nWith the expectations of countless Taiwanese citizens, he was elected to the Taiwanese presidency. He will not let the former disgraceful 20th century return. Taiwan has never been a territory of the Republic of China. Taiwan will be freed as a 'Taiwan Republic' separate from China."
 
 POLITICS_WU_SHU_CHEN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 11th July 1953, in Madou, Tainan County, Taiwan Province, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! The first lady of Chen Shui-bian was by Chen's side throughout his pro-democracy movement. She helped Chen Shui-bian during his efforts to liberate Taiwan, and worked with him on his dream of Taiwanese independence. Due to her political activities, she suffered an attempted assassination in 1985 with \"unknown background\". The attempted truck assassination left her paraplegia, unable to get out of a wheelchair for life.\n\nAnd Chen Shui-bian's assassination in 2004 was her second wound. The KMT took away half of her, once again her remaining half. All that remains is the unfulfilled dream of a dead husband; Taiwan's perfect freedom. She will not be frustrated forever. Taiwan must be liberated. The self-proclaimed 'Republic of China' must be extinguished forever. And, the hateful Kuomintang must also burn from hell. And in the burning hell, the supporters of the Kuomintang will belatedly remember that they assassinated someone they should never have killed. But, there will be no way for them to atone for their sins.\n\n§RNever.§!"
 
 POLITICS_ANNETTE_LU_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 7th June 1944, in Tōen Town, Shinchiku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan\n§YPolitical Career:§! Annette Lu, a participant in Taiwan's \"Tangwai\" movement, a democracy movement in the 20th century, and a well-known feminist activist in Taiwan, was not mentioned as a possible presidential candidate despite her long political career. Her influence within the DPP was limited, and her highest political position was likely to be vice president. If the assassination of Chen Shui-bian had not occurred.\n\nSince the assassination of her political colleague and longtime partner Chen Shui-bian, She had the heavy burden of inheriting the dream of \"Taiwan liberation\", which Chen Shui-bian could not achieve. But she won't stop. To inherit the dream of a dead old colleague and make it the dream of all Taiwanese citizens."

 CHI_year_of_the_dragon_desc: "According to the traditional Chinese calendar, 2000 is the Year of the Dragon. As much as China symbolizes theyself as a Dragon, CE 2000 is quite interesting year. We have a presidential election in year of the dragon, and the Hungry Red Dragon is getting ready to blow flames at us. It's time for a leader who can protect Taiwan. Who could be the knight to defeat the Red Dragon?"
 
 CHI_coalition_with_lee_teng_hui: "Coalition with Lee Teng-hui"
 CHI_coalition_with_lee_teng_hui_desc: "The 20th century of ideological confrontation has ended and the 21st century has come. While Kuomintang remains a right-wing party, most politicians in the KMT now support the Communist Party of China based on Chinese pan-nationalism rather than anti-communism. But there are still conscientious politicians inside the KMT who reject Mainland China. former president Lee Teng-hui is ready to end his relationship with KMT's traitors and support the DPP for Taiwan's freedom and independence."
 
 CHI_kuomintang_corruption_investigation: "Kuomintang Corruption Investigation"
 CHI_kuomintang_corruption_investigation_desc: "Kuomintang was Taiwan's leading political party throughout the 20th century, with absolute power under martial law for decades. Of course, the corruption and embezzlement committed by the KMT during that time is not negligible. The new government will investigate corruption cases in the KMT in the past, and show that they are untrusted parties."
 
 CHI_securing_funding_for_DPP: "Securing Funding for DPP"
 CHI_securing_funding_for_DPP_desc: "Unlike the KMT, which has led a dictatorship for decades, the DPP is relatively poor. We need the support of many citizens to grow the size of the party."
 
 CHI_rally_for_the_DPP: "Rally for the DPP"
 CHI_rally_for_the_DPP_desc: "The younger generation will exchange stories about the DPP in the Internet community and realize why Taiwan should be a different country from China and their patriotism as a Taiwanese."

 CHI_the_reform_of_the_single_member_constituencies: "Reform of the Single-member Constiuencies"
 CHI_the_reform_of_the_single_member_constituencies_desc: "To stabilize Taiwan's politics, a two-party system is more appropriate than a multi-party system. If elections were held under the election law, especially in favor of the multi-party system, Pan Green, divided into several parties, would not be able to win against the united Kuomintang. That's why Taiwan's parliamentary election laws should be 'single-member district'."
 
 CHI_contact_with_the_vatican: "Contact with the Vatican"
 CHI_contact_with_the_vatican_desc: "Although most countries cut diplomatic ties with us during the Cold War, the Vatican has still maintained friendly relations with us because of its religious animosity toward communism. We will reaffirm our diplomatic relations with them once again."

 CHI_the_DPP_will_save_taiwan_desc: "Which party really thinks about Taiwan's future? Is it Kuomintang, loyal to [PRC.GetLeader]? Or is it a Democratic Progressive Party loyal to [ROOT.GetAdjective]? The public is increasingly sympathetic to Taiwan's nationalism and we have the support of citizens who will fight for Taiwan's freedom."
 
 CHI_rewards_for_supporters: "Rewards for Supporters"
 CHI_rewards_for_supporters_desc: "Not all DPP supporters voted for Chen because they support Taiwanese nationalism. Taiwan was hit economically by the dot-com bubble crisis in 2000, and Chen Shui-bian is seeking advice from several economists to escape the economic hit."
 
 CHI_the_leadership_principle: "The Leadership Principle"
 CHI_the_leadership_principle_desc: "Within the DPP, two factions are at odds. The moderates, who call themselves 'Huádú', argue that the status quo itself is effectively the same as Taiwan independence. But Chen Shui-bian doesn't agree with this. Taiwan's true independence can only be achieved through the dissolution of the Republic of China and the declaration of the founding of the Taiwan Republic."
 
 CHI_reuniting_taiwan_culture: "Reuniting Taiwan Culture"

 CHI_honest_leader: "The Honest Leader"
 CHI_honest_leader_desc: "Apart from Chen Shui-bian's enthusiasm for Taiwan's independence, it is true that his political morality is slightly flawed. He needs an appropriate money for a comfortable retirement after he leaves office. But it's not a big crime for a great patriot to get the state coffers a little, is it? He will provide greater national interest to the citizens of Taiwan than he has taken."
 
 CHI_recruiting_talents: "Recruiting Talents"
 CHI_recruiting_talents_desc: "Taiwan Island has a lot of talent, but our old traditions and laws make it impossible for more than half of them to reach their capacities. Women, LGBT, and other minorities, the DPP and Chen Shui-bian agrees that the enactment of 'Act of Gender Equality in Employment' for numerous social minorities is very important for Taiwan's future. All companies cannot discriminate against workers' employment or promotion because they are gender or LGBTQ. All women and LGBTQ workers must earn equal pay, welfare, and employment opportunities for straight male employees.

 CHI_minimizing_economic_shock: "Minimizing Economic Shock"

 CHI_overcoming_dot_com_bubble: "Overcoming Dot-com Bubble"
 CHI_overcoming_dot_com_bubble_desc: "In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, many IT companies are going bankrupt. If we focus on protecting businesses rather than workers, we will be able to prevent good IT companies from going bankrupt and being dismantled and increase national competitiveness.

This military reform is referred to as the \"Two National Defense Laws\" because it consists of two laws: civilian control of the military, and reorganize the Ministry of National Defense into a new organization."
 
 CHI_toward_independence: "Toward Independence"
 CHI_toward_independence_desc: "It's impossible for us to take the entire mainland of China. It's an unattainable dream. But at least we need an army that can threaten the coast of mainland China. The centre of [PRC.GetName]'s economic power is concentrated in coastal cities, and if we can hit them, it will be a chance for us to gain freedom."
 
 CHI_look_at_the_border: "Look at the Border"
 CHI_look_at_the_border_desc: "Some of our territories are very close to mainland China. Yes. This is a story about Lienchiang County.
