 CAM_king_norodom_sihanouk_desc: "The coup in 1997 left a massive purge of Cambodia's monarchists, but Hun Sen did not directly remove the king. But now Norodom Sihanouk's power can only be held within his own palace. He is still against the dictatorship of Hun Sen, but his resistance is only a small voice."

 POLITICS_HUN_SEN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 5th August 1952, in Peam Kaoh Sna, Stung Trang, Kampong Cham, French Indochina\n§YPolitical Career:§! An officer in Khmer Rouge, the communist regime that controlled Cambodia during the Cold War, Hun Sen was able to control Cambodia's government, which has been in turmoil since the 1980s.\n\nBut After Cambodia's communist government collapsed, Hun Sen was defeated by the Royalist Party, FUNCINPEC, in elections under UN supervision. However, he refused to admit his election defeat. Hun Sen declared that he was prepared to wage a civil war instead of ceding power, and FUNCINPEC had to accept a compromise of 'coalition government' with Hun Sen.\n\nBut the coalition with royalists did not last long. If he could take power alone, he was ready to do so. The 1997 coup immediately removed FUNCINPEC's influence from the government. There is still a formal monarch, 'House of Norodom', in Cambodia. But now the 'real' king of Cambodia is Hun Sen. All the power in Cambodia comes from him, and the royalists are hiding in the dark."
