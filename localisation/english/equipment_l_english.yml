The FSV was introduced into Australian Army units in the mid-1960s following the withdrawal of the Saladins and was armed with a 76mm gun, a .30 caliber coaxial machine gun and a .30 caliber machine gun mounted on the roof of the vehicle's turret. The M113 FSV served until the late 1970s. It was commonly referred to by crews as the "Beast"."

 AST_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "An M113 variant similar to the M113 FSV, but using the turret from the FV101 Scorpion light tank, instead of that of the Saladin armoured car. This turret was equipped with an Image Intensifier sight for the main armament. This sight was the first effective passive night sight fitted to an Australian AFV, giving the MRVs a night fighting capability exceeding the Leopard AS1 and all other Australian AFVs of the period."

They were developed in the early 1970s and used in exercises in northern Western Australia from 1973. This LRPV was developed from the six-wheel drive variant of the Australian Army's Land Rover Perentie in the late 1980s. The design was intended to be used by the SASR to patrol remote regions of Australia. The LRPV is mechanically simple, and relatively easy to maintain in the field. It has a crew of three.

After almost two years of trialing, it was announced in December 1992 that Australia would purchase 97 LAV’s from Canada, to supplement the 15 vehicles already held.

It is designed to carry out a variety of utility missions with maximum flexibility; this is achieved via several different "mission modules" specialized for various tasks which are available separately from the vehicle. Australian MRAVs incorporate a personell carrying module, armed with the FLW-200 remote weapons system with either a 40mm AGL or .50 cal M2."
